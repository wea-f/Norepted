# Norepted
Youtube Video Embedder
Norepted is a youtube video embedder/blocker/player.
# Features
- Norepted will prevent the annoying video ads however the pop-up ads will still appear (You could just close it).
- Norepted will also play restricted videos by your school organization.
- No youtube-related things would be in your history, only the site, Norepted will be.
- You can save a video by pressing the "Copy" button and it will copy the link. Paste this link on another tab and bookmark it. Notice the link will take you to the embedded video that completely fills the whole screen.

2. Next, Press the green "LAUNCH" button or press the "Enter" key on your keyboard. <br>
3. Now the video will appear down below, it may take a few seconds depending on how fast your computer is. <br>
4. In the end of the video, a wall of 3x3 recommended videos will appear. You can copy the links of these videos and paste it in the orange box and press the green "LAUNCH" button to restart the cycle.
# How it works
  Norepted embeds a video based on your youtube video link. Similarly to how your teacher embeds a video on Google Slides for class.
The code simply takes the video id from the inputed url and attaches it to youtube-nocookie.com, the embeded youtube video link. That link then goes into a html video element and your video appears just like that! <br>
